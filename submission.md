There are two tracks available for applications to the San Diego Undergraduate Tech Conference:

### Track 1: Completed and Near-Completed Projects
- Submit an abstract of the project that you would use in your paper (about 250 words). *(Don’t worry about perfection. You can edit this for your final Summer submission.)*
- Submit materials you have already developed for this project.

---

### Track 2: Emerging Projects
- Submit a project proposal (≥ 300 words). This can be in bullet or paragraph form.
- Include a **Proof of Concept**, which should demonstrate feasibility. Examples include:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset you’re working with
  - Initial basic experiments
  - Demo or simplified simulation
  - Detailed analytical argument, perhaps including examples of similar projects
